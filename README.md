# Project Title
To Do List
To Do List is a web application using Java program as the backend connected to the front-end technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project is done as part of the QA Academy.

## Getting Started
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Java 7 or later

Eclipse or Intellij (or any other suitable IDE)
Maven
SpringBoot
Visual Studio Code


### Installing
To setup a development environment, you will need to clone either the master-branch or the dev-branch of this repository.

Once the directory is cloned, open it in the IDE of your choice.

Run the 'ToDoList-Master' and the spring application should start and connect to the H2, displaying task and task list tables.

To access the front-end open up the Springust-master\src\main\resources\static\html in your file explorer and open the 'index.html' file.

## Running the tests
All tests are located under the src/test/java, inside the com.qa.todolist package. inside you should see a further 3 packages 'rest', 'selenuium' and 'unittest'. 

Unit Tests
These tests cover some basics, such as testing individual units of source code..

There are also Mockito tests which mocks the objects and allows us to verify the behaviour of the system under test without establishing connections.

If you are using an IDE such as Intellij or Eclipse, you will be able to run these tests by right-clicking the classes and selecting the "Run as J-Unit test" option
or  you can right-click the project folder and select the 'Coverage As...' option.
